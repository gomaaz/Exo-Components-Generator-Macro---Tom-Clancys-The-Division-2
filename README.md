## 📜 Description

This AutoHotkey script automates the process of farming **Exotic Components** by repeatedly:

1. Creating a **new agent**  
2. Opening the **starter cache**  
3. Looting two **Exotic weapons**  
4. **Deconstructing** them for Exotic Components  
5. **Deleting** the character  
6. Repeating the process in a **continuous loop**

It’s primarily intended for players who already completed the game and want to automate exotic component farming on a secondary account.

## 📜 Usage

Just run the .exe, it will detect the game (or geforce now client) and will display the description as an overlay tooltip to the game.
From there you can start (F2), Stop/reload (F3) or Quit (F4) the script

The game needs to stay in focus! It will not work in the background. Unexpected behaviour could be the cause by switching to e.g. desktop back and forth. 

You can make custom changes with the ahk file. 
Therefor you will need autohotkey v1 - https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

## 🧩 Requirements

1. **Ultimate Edition** with **Year One Pass**  
2. Purchase the **Deluxe Pack** in the in-game store  
   - `ESC → Store → Add-ons → Deluxe Pack`
3. Free up **one empty agent slot** on the main agent selection screen  
4. Use **default key mappings** (no custom controls)  
5. The **rightmost existing agent** must be placed in the safe house **"The Shop"**  
6. Set inventory sorting to **"Recent"** (clock icon)  
7. Start the macro when a **blank agent slot** is selected on the main agent selection screen

- The script depends on **timed key presses** (`Sleep`, `Send`)  
- There are **no safety checks, failsafes, or UI validations**
- Load times vary between systems — you may need to **increase sleep delays**
