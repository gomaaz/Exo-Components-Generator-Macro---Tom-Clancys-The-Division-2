## üìú Description

This AutoHotkey script automates the process of farming **Exotic Components** by repeatedly:

1. Creating a **new agent**  
2. Opening the **starter cache**  
3. Looting two **Exotic weapons**  
4. **Deconstructing** them for Exotic Components  
5. **Deleting** the character  
6. Repeating the process in a **continuous loop**

It‚Äôs primarily intended for players who already completed the game and want to automate exotic component farming on a secondary account.

## üìú Usage

Just run the .exe, it will detect the game (or geforce now client) and will display the description as an overlay tooltip to the game.
From there you can start (F2), Stop/reload (F3) or Quit (F4) the script. 

The game needs to stay in focus! It will not work in the background. 
Unexpected behaviour could be the cause by switching to e.g. desktop back and forth. 
See below for best practices whith using in background.

You can make custom changes with the ahk file. 
Therefor you will need autohotkey v1 - https://www.autohotkey.com/download/
